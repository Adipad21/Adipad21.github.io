                            <p>Assignment 4 involves recreating a specific University of South Carolina webpage. The task requires employing HTML5 elements (header, footer, nav, section, aside, article) in a traditional header/content/footer structure, coupled with CSS Flexbox for styling. The webpage must feature a responsive navigation bar that remains visible on small screens, use placeholder images, and have all text replaced with Lorem Ipsum. Additionally, all hyperlinks should redirect to '#', and the color scheme must match the original page using a color picker tool. The assignment is designed to enhance the ability to accurately replicate HTML/CSS layouts, with particular emphasis on flexbox utilization for responsive design.</p>

                            <p>Assignment 5 involves designing an interactive web page that incorporates three main features: a click-triggered image change with size and aspect ratio consistency, a slider-driven full-circle image rotation for a dynamic visual effect, and an interactive column where users can add star images with each click, ensuring a neat and visually appealing arrangement. The goal is to blend seamless functionality with an intuitive and engaging user interface.</p>
