        <h1>Mini Autonomous Self Driving Car: Model UNDERDOG</h1>
        <h3><underline>Design Summary</underline></h3>
        <p>Model UNDERDOG operates using an electromagnetic field sensor to travel autonomously across a 90 ft track. This track has an 
            embedded wire propagating a 1 amp, 20 kHz square wave signal. Our vehicle model consists of three main systems: 
            1) Magnetic Distance Sensor, 2) Buck Converter, 3) Frequency to voltage converter.</p>
        <p>Magnetic Distance Sensor has five subsystems: a) LC Resonant Circuit: Current from the track gives off pulses of magnetic field, 
            and inductors have the ability to convert this magnetic field into pulses of voltage - the closer the inductor, the stronger 
            the voltage. The circuit acts as a low pass filter converting a square wave signal into a sine wave signal. 
            b) Amplification Circuit: Amplify the input voltage into a desired output voltage by adjusting the gain using a non-inverting 
            amplifier circuit. c) Rectification Circuit: It conducts current primarily in one direction. Also ensures the voltage is always 
            positive. d) Peak Detection Low Pass Filter: Reduces the ripple and the peak detector holds the peak value of the op-amp output, 
            and uses it to produce a DC signal. e) Input Protection: Zener diode ensures that the voltage does not exceed 3.3V. This voltage 
            acts as an input for the microcontroller (max pin voltage is 3.3V).</p>
        <p>The Buck Converter System takes in an input from the main power supply being 7.2VDC and lowers the voltage to a range that is 
            acceptable that the microcontroller can handle which is 3.3VDC. The circuit consists of a gate driver TC4428, IRF540N MOSFET, 
            and a MBR 1060 diode. The TC4428 is used to drive the gate of the MOSFET. The IRF540N is used for the voltage switching of the 
            circuit. The 1060 diode is used to prevent feedback onto the circuit the wiring for the motor is also wired in here.</p>
        <p>Frequency to voltage converter takes in an input voltage and outputs a frequency. This is inputted into the PWM analog-in port 
            of the microcontroller. There is also a schmitt trigger used in this circuit where it is used as a voltage detector and its 
            switching properties to give a clean square wave output. Wired to the schmitt trigger is the wheel encoder sensor that gives 
            feedback to the microcontroller so that the user can determine what changes are needed to make the system better.</p>
